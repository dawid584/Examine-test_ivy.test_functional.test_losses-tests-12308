Ensure a comprehensive examination of all tests to confirm their alignment with the current test writing policy.
Ensure the tests follow the following guidelines, among others:

1. Avoid restricting the use of get_dtypes to specific kinds (float, int) unless absolutely necessary; the default value should be used when possible.
2. Avoid the use of assume to bypass specific data types.
3. Unless necessary, avoid restricting the generation of numbers with min_value or max_value. For example, it is acceptable to set a maximum value for the pad function if the pad_value value can halt the test.
4. Ensure proper use of strategies.
5. Verify that all tests are executed rather than skipped by test_values=False, unless the test logic is implemented within the test body itself.
6. Confirm that testing is comprehensive and complete, meaning that all possible combinations of inputs are tested.
7. Avoid manually setting test parameters, including native array flags, container flags, the number of positional arguments, etc.
8. Ensure that no parameters are skipped during testing.

Always refer to the documentation for Ivy Tests and Ivy Frontend Tests for complete test writing policy.

If a test function does not require update, simply mark the function in the list as completed, otherwise create an issue for that test function.
